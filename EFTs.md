### What is an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund)?

An **Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)** is like a basket of different investments (like stocks, bonds, or commodities) that you can buy and sell on a stock exchange, just like you would with a single stock. Think of it as a way to invest in a whole group of assets at once, rather than picking individual stocks or bonds. For more details, you can check out [How to Invest and What It Is - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp).

### Key Attributes and Concepts of ETFs:

1. **Diversification**: By investing in an ETF, you're spreading your money across many different assets, which can help reduce risk. More details are available at [How to Invest and What It Is - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) and [Types and Benefits Explained - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-etf.asp).
2. **Liquidity**: ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the trading day, just like individual stocks, making them very liquid. Learn more at [How to Invest and What It Is - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp).
3. **Lower Costs**: Generally, ETFs have lower expense ratios (fees) compared to mutual funds, and they often have fewer brokerage commissions. See [How to Invest and What It Is - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) for more information.
4. **Types of ETFs**: There are various types of ETFs, including:
   - **Index ETFs**: These track a specific index, like the S&P 500. More information can be found [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp).
   - **Sector ETFs**: These focus on a specific sector, like technology or healthcare. Details can be found [here](https://www.etmoney.com/learn/mutual-funds/what-are-exchange-traded-funds-etfs/).

### How Do ETFs Work?

When you buy shares of an ETF, you're buying a piece of the entire basket of assets that the ETF holds. The value of your ETF shares will fluctuate throughout the trading day based on the performance of the underlying assets.
