### What is an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund)?

An **Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)** is like a basket of different investments (like stocks, bonds, or commodities) that you can buy and sell on a stock exchange, just like you would with a single stock. Think of it as a way to invest in a whole group of assets at once, rather than picking individual stocks or bonds. For more details, you can check out [How to Invest and What It Is - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp).

### Key Attributes and Concepts of ETFs:

1. **Diversification**: By investing in an ETF, you're spreading your money across many different assets, which can help reduce risk. More details are available at [How to Invest and What It Is - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) and [Types and Benefits Explained - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-etf.asp).
2. **Liquidity**: ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the trading day, just like individual stocks, making them very liquid. Learn more at [How to Invest and What It Is - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp).
3. **Lower Costs**: Generally, ETFs have lower expense ratios (fees) compared to mutual funds, and they often have fewer brokerage commissions. See [How to Invest and What It Is - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) for more information.
4. **Types of ETFs**: There are various types of ETFs, including:

The value of your ETF shares will fluctuate throughout the trading day based on the performance of the underlying assets.
