**Market cap**, short for market capitalization, refers to the total value of all a company's shares of stock combined. Imagine you own a giant pizza, and this pizza represents the entire company's stock. Each slice of pizza is a share of stock. The market cap is basically the total price of all these slices put together.

Here's how it's calculated:

**Market Cap = Current Share Price × Total Number of Shares**

For example, let's say you have a company called "PizzaTech." If one share of PizzaTech is currently priced at ₹100, and there are 10 million shares in total, the market cap would be:

₹100 (share price) × 10,000,000 (total shares) = ₹1,000,000,000

So, the market cap of PizzaTech would be ₹1 billion.

### Why is Market Cap Important?
1. **Size Indicator**: It helps investors understand the size of a company. Generally, companies are categorized into different sizes: large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap.
   - **Large-cap**: Companies with market caps over $10 billion. These are usually well-established and stable.
   - **Mid-cap**: Companies with market caps between $2 billion and $10 billion. These companies are often growing and have potential.
   - **Small-cap**: Companies with market caps below $2 billion. These are usually newer companies with higher growth potential but also higher risk.

2. **Risk and Return**: Larger companies (large-cap) tend to be more stable and less risky but may have slower growth. Smaller companies (small-cap) may grow faster but are usually riskier.

3. **Investment Decisions**: Investors use market cap to make informed decisions about which companies to invest in based on their financial goals and risk tolerance.

Think of market cap as a way to gauge the size and potential of a company, just like you might look at the size and toppings of a pizza to decide which one to buy.
